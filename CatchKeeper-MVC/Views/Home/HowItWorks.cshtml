        <h2>How Catch Keeper Works</h2>
        <p>From the moment a fish hits the net to the patterns you discover weeks later.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6">
            <h3>1. Log the catch in seconds</h3>
            <p>
                After you land a fish, open Catch Keeper and record the essentials:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Date and time of the catch</li>
                <li>Species, length, and weight</li>
                <li>Location, bait, and technique</li>
                <li>Weather details and quick notes</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The input form is intentionally simple so you can log a catch quickly and get back to fishing.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-md-6">
            <h3>2. Build your personal fishing history</h3>
            <p>
                Every catch you log is stored in a clean, searchable catch log. Over time, it becomes your own
                history of lakes, rivers, seasons, and conditions.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can review your catches at any time, update details, or remove entries that were test logs.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row" style="margin-top: 25px;">
        <div class="col-md-6">
            <h3>3. Spot patterns and trends</h3>
            <p>
                Scroll through your log before a trip to see what worked last time:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Which baits produced in low-light vs. bright conditions</li>
                <li>Which spots shine during pre-spawn, summer, or fall transition</li>
                <li>How weather shifts affected size and numbers</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="col-md-6">
            <h3>4. Fish with a game plan</h3>
            <p>
                Instead of guessing, you launch each trip with a plan based on your own data—no social media hype,
                no rumors, just real results from time on the water.
            </p>
            <p>
                Catch Keeper is designed to stay out of the way so you can focus on what matters: making the next cast.
