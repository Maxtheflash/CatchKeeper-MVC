                Catch Keeper was designed with a simple mission: <strong>to help anglers fish smarter</strong>.
                Not with guesswork, not with rumors — but with real data gathered from real days on the water.
            </p>

            <p>
                As a lifelong angler, I’ve spent countless days chasing bass on Ohio lakes and rivers,
                experimenting with baits, techniques, and seasonal patterns. Over the years, I realized that the
                best advantage any angler can have is <strong>
                    their own experience — organized, accessible, and
                    easy to learn from
                </strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
                That idea inspired Catch Keeper: a clean, intuitive fishing log that makes it effortless to record
                every catch and uncover the trends behind your most successful days. It’s built with the mindset
                of someone who’s tied on jigs at sunrise, waited out the slow bites, celebrated personal-best fish,
                and learned something new from every cast.
            </p>

            <p>
                Whether you're a weekend bank angler, a tournament competitor, or just someone who loves the peace
                of a quiet morning on the water, Catch Keeper helps turn each trip into a smarter one—powered by
                your own knowledge, not just luck.

                    <li><strong>Built by an angler</strong> — shaped by real fishing experience, not generic app design.</li>
                    <li><strong>Simple but powerful logging</strong> — record catches in seconds while staying focused on the water.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pattern-driven insights</strong> — pull meaning from weather, bait choice, location, and seasonal trends.</li>
                    <li><strong>Designed for growth</strong> — the more you log, the more effective your future trips become.</li>

        <h3>A Tool by an Angler, for Anglers</h3>
        <p>
            Catch Keeper reflects years of trial-and-error, early mornings, late evenings, lost fish, great fish,
            and every lesson learned along the way. It’s more than an app — it’s a digital extension of a real
            angler’s notebook.
        </p>

        <p>
            My goal is to help anglers elevate their craft, develop confidence in their decisions on the water,
            and relive the stories behind every catch. If this tool helps you put together one more pattern,
            make one more smart adjustment, or land one more fish of a lifetime — then it’s done its job.
