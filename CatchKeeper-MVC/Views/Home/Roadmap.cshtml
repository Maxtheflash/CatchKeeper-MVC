            <h3>Short-Term Goals (MVP & Polish)</h3>
            <p>
                These are the near-term items focused on making Catch Keeper feel complete, stable, and ready to show
                in a portfolio, demo, or classroom environment.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Validation & UX</strong> – Add clear validation messages and friendly error states to all forms.</li>
                <li><strong>Improved Details View</strong> – Style the catch details page like a “profile card” for each catch.</li>
                <li><strong>Consistent Branding</strong> – Tighten colors, fonts, and spacing across all pages for a cohesive feel.</li>
                <li><strong>Sample Data Script</strong> – Seed realistic demo catches for quick setup on a new machine.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Personal Dev Milestones</h3>
            <p>
                This project isn’t just an app—it’s a stepping stone in your journey as a developer and angler building tools
                for anglers.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Refine this ASP.NET MVC app into a <strong>portfolio-grade project</strong>.</li>
                <li>Document the architecture and decisions in a short <strong>readme / case study</strong>.</li>
                <li>Deploy a future version to the web (Azure, etc.) to gain <strong>real hosting experience</strong>.</li>
                <li>Use this project in <strong>interviews and conversations</strong> to showcase full-stack skills.</li>

        <h2>Feature Roadmap</h2>
        <p>Ideas to evolve Catch Keeper from a class project into a real-world tool.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-4 kk-feature-card">
            <h3>Phase 1 – Enhanced Logging</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Support simple <strong>tagging</strong> (e.g., “Bank”, “Boat”, “Night”, “Tournament”).</li>
                <li>Add ability to upload or attach a <strong>photo per catch</strong>.</li>
                <li>Include basic <strong>search and filtering</strong> on species, location, and date range.</li>
                <li>Show summary metrics: total catches, average size, favorite baits.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="col-md-4 kk-feature-card">
            <h3>Phase 2 – Insights & Analytics</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Charts for catches by <strong>month, species, and bait</strong>.</li>
                <li>Highlight <strong>top-producing locations</strong> and conditions.</li>
                <li>“Trip summary” view that groups catches by fishing trip or date.</li>
                <li>Basic <strong>pattern suggestions</strong> (e.g., “Most of your best fish came on overcast days with jigs”).</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="col-md-4 kk-feature-card">
            <h3>Phase 3 – Connected Experience</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>User accounts and authentication so anglers can keep their logs private and secure.</li>
                <li>Option to mark catches as “shareable” and generate a simple public link or summary card.</li>
                <li>Potential integration with <strong>weather APIs</strong> to auto-capture conditions.</li>
                <li>Exploration of <strong>mobile or responsive-first design</strong> for on-the-water logging.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Future Vision</h2>
        <p>Where Catch Keeper could go with more time, data, and experimentation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6">
            <h3>AI & Pattern Recognition</h3>
            <p>
                As the log grows, Catch Keeper could learn from catch history and help suggest:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Recommended <strong>baits and techniques</strong> for current conditions.</li>
                <li>Which spots to prioritize based on previous trips and seasons.</li>
                <li>Subtle trends that are easy to miss, like small temperature or wind changes.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This would turn Catch Keeper into more than a log—it becomes a smart pattern assistant for serious anglers.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-md-6">
            <h3>Community & Collaboration</h3>
            <p>
                Longer-term, there’s potential to connect anglers in controlled, privacy-respecting ways:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Private sharing of selected catches with trusted friends or partners.</li>
                <li>Optional community heat maps with anonymized data.</li>
                <li>Event or tournament modes to track catches in real-time.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Even if these features never all ship, documenting the vision here shows how this project can scale beyond a single user.
