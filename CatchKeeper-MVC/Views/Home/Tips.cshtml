            <h3>Match the conditions</h3>
            <p>
                Use darker baits in low-light or stained water and more natural colors in clear water.
                In Catch Keeper, note the water clarity and sky conditions so you can repeat what works.

            <h3>Fish the highest-percentage spots</h3>
            <p>
                Focus on structure that naturally holds fish—points, grass edges, rock transitions, and current seams.
                When you log a catch, record the type of cover or structure that produced.

            <h3>Let the bait do the talking</h3>
            <p>
                Start with a confident retrieve, then adjust speed or cadence based on how fish react.
                Use the notes field to capture what triggered bites (pauses, pops, steady retrieves, etc.).

            <h3>Think seasonal movement</h3>
            <p>
                Bass and other gamefish move with the seasons: shallow in spring, deeper in summer, chasing bait in fall.
                Your log helps you see when and where they showed up each year.

            <h3>Stay organized on the water</h3>
            <p>
                Keep the gear you actually use within reach and label your boxes. A few dialed-in confidence baits
                beat a boat full of unused tackle.

            <h3>Protect the resource</h3>
            <p>
                Handle fish with care, support their weight horizontally, and release them quickly when possible.
                Healthy fisheries today mean better trips tomorrow.
